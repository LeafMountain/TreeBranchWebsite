### Pathfinding

The pathfinding is a flood-filling algorithm which uses a space for the origin and fills in a clockwise manner. Since the game areas in this game are small a more effective alternative wasn't necessary. | ![Image of Character Sheet](/img/placeholder.gif)

### State Machine

![Image of Character Sheet](/img/placeholder.gif) | The decisions of the AI was made purely on who was the closest enemy unit. The simplicity of this AI came from the limited resources I had to develop the AI but it also gave the player a strategy to defeat the enemy. By placing resilient characters at the front the player were able to defend the weakest characters.
