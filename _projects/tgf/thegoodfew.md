The Good Few is a colourful turn-based role-playing game sprinkled with city-building elements and resource management.

The game revolves around the story of a band of mercenaries who get drawn into an unending conflict between a trinity of nations, each with its own reasons for bloodshed and conquest.

Featuring a class and sub-class-based leveling system, an upgradeable player hub, customizable equipment, exciting character development, a variety of different environments to explore, and obviously lots of enemies and bosses to defeat.

In its current iteration (early alpha) it mostly has basic functionality such as functional menus, mission select, battles, sfx, music.
