The biggest focus of this project was to get a responsive move system that the player easily could control. This systems was inspired by platformers like Super Mario 64 and Banjo Kazooie.

A huge takeway from making this move system was the importance of the camera movement and positioning. The camera following when the player moved too far away mad a huge difference in the feeling of control.
