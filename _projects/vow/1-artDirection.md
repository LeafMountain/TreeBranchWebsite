The graphical vision of the game sprang out of the combination of available skill-set restrictions, 
time constraints and also the colourful and simplistic artstyles of some classic turn-based RPG games 
such as Final Fantasy Tactics or Fire Emblem.

We wanted to theme up the various factions within the game with different kinds of weapons, armour and 
colour coding. However due to previously mentioned time constraints we decided to scale down our scope 
for the initial prototype and only go with colour coding the different units of each human faction.

The Player controlled characters however are all uniquely designed and implemented in the game, 
each with different classes and visuals.
