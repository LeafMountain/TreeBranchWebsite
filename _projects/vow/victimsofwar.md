Not every war is about soldiers and leaders. 

Not every person has a gun. 

In Victims of War you as the player will be cast into a war ravaged city during the 90's and relive their stories.

Through the eyes of the civilians you must survive, but at what price? 


Victims of War is a turn based, print and play, board game of survival. 
The players will take on the role of three civilians each who must do what is necessary to survive numerous 
military threats and the fellow desperate citizens in a war ravaged city in eastern Europe. 


Will you survive for seven days and seven nights?


Victims of War is a complete three dimensional game with buildings, game board pieces, character cards and 
character lore. 

Players will find themselves in tough situations where they have to make hard choices or risk death. 


Each moment is a fight for survival.



Supervised by award winning board game creator Phil Eklund, veteran game creator Jon Manker and Graphical Artist Camilla Qvick.
