Undead End (Project Name) is a co-op multiplayer top-down survival shooter set in a dark post-apocalyptic zombie ridden world.
<br>
Your goal as survivors is simply surviving, you cannot stay in place or you will be swarmed by the unliving hordes roaming the city. 
<br>
You have to find somewhere safe to hold up and regroup, to plan your way out of the city and consider places that could still hold useful items or weapons vital to the perseverance of your group.
<br>
<br>
In its current iteration (early alpha) it mostly has basic functionality such as different weapons, an entire city level shrouded in darkness to explore and survive.
