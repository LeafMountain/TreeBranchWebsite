Undead End (Project Name) is a co-op multiplayer top-down survival shooter set in a dark post-apocalyptic zombie ridden world.

Your goal as survivors is simply surviving, you cannot stay in place or you will be swarmed by the unliving hordes roaming the city. You have to find somewhere safe to hold up and regroup, to plan your way out of the city and consider places that could still hold useful items or weapons vital to the perseverance of your group.

In its current iteration (early alpha) it mostly has basic functionality such as different weapons, an entire city level shrouded in darkness to explore and survive.

The graphical vision of the game was initially heavily inspired by the grim dark artstyle of Darkest Dungeon, Borderlands and The Walking Dead Comics, but as work progressed it evolved into it's own style using less saturated shades of gradient colours combined with high-contrast shadowing.
