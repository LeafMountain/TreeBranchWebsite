Christian is a technical Animator and coordinator of Game projects. 

He's always been "that IT-guy" people know and turned to. He enjoys rigging, animating and of course playing games.
On my spare time I tend to play a lot of PnP RPG games, and I have a vast interest in world building and storytelling.
