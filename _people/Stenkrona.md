<br>
Axels game and level design is just as good as his walk is cool. 
Abandoned as a child, a default walk animation found him, took him in 
and raised him as its own.
<br>
He has now embarked on a journey to spread laughter and great game 
experiences to the world.
<br>
His role at Tree Branch is that of the event-, level designer and 
general coding within Unity3D.
