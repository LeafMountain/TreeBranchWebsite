Axels game and level design is just as good as his walk is cool. 
Abandoned as a child, a default walk animation found him, took him in and raised him as its own.

He has now embarked on a journey to spread laughter and great game 
experiences to the world.

His role at Tree Branch is that of the event-, level designer and 
general coding within Unity3D.
