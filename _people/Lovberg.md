Alexander is a huge geek when it comes to all technical stuff. 

The love for coding came from the amazing feeling of making a system automatically take care of itself or work with minimal effort. With that said, even if he likes that everything works with minimal effort, Alex is not afraid to put effort into the system to make it work that way.

He's main philosophy when it comes to game development is that the process of creating a game should be at least as fun to make as it will be to play.
