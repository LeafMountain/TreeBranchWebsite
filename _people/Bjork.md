Patrik would define himself as a 3D/2D generalist and a graphics
oriented game designer with indie upstart aspirations and
a background in the RTS modding community.
<br>
His role at Tree Branch is as the Lead Artist, he mostly enjoys 
working on environmental assets but also like creating the odd 
character model to switch things up from now and again.
