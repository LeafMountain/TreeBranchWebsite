                TREE BRANCH was originally founded in 2016 as Combine Studios. Then consisting of a group of likeminded swedish video game development students, from the ashes of that group of indie upstarts sprouted the seeds for TREE BRANCH.

                Our mission is to bring back the old-school tactical JRPG genre to the modern day world, integrating new
                ways to play while sticking to the core concepts that worked back in the day.
