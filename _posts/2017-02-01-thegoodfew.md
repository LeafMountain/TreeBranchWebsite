The Good Few is a colourful turn-based role-playing game sprinkled with city-building elements and resource management.

The game revolves around the story of a band of mercenaries who get drawn into an unending conflict between a trinity of nations, each with its own reasons for bloodshed and conquest.

Featuring a class and sub-class-based levelling system, an upgradeable player hub, customizable equipment, exciting character development, a variety of different environments to explore, and obviously lots of enemies and bosses to defeat.

In its current iteration (early alpha) it mostly has basic functionality such as functional menus, mission select, battles, sfx, music.

The graphical vision of the game sprang out of the combination of available skill-set restrictions, time constraints and also the colourful and simplistic artstyles of some classic turn-based RPG games such as Final Fantasy Tactics or Fire Emblem.

We wanted to theme up the various factions within the game with different kinds of weapons, armour and colour coding. However due to previously mentioned time constraints we decided to scale down our scope for the initial prototype and only go with colour coding the different units of each human faction. The Player controlled characters however are all uniquely designed and implemented in the game, each with different classes and visuals.
