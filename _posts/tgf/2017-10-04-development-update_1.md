Currently we are working on our Tactical Turn-based RPG “The Good Few”. An epic tale of a group of former sellswords struggling to survive in a wartorn fantasy world. We currently have a few basic playable classes.
<br>
<br>
Acolyte – A Healer class focused on keeping the party alive and offering buffs! <br>
Apprentice – A magic-using class with focus on damage dealing and AoE! <br>
Archer – Bow and Arrow, all you ever need! <br>
Scout – With dagger in hand this class will dash out massive melee damage! <br>
Warrior – A melee class focused on shield and sword, able to deal and take a punch in equal measure! <br>
Our heroes are Alena Myst, Gramps, Jaques, Milo, Olivia and Wilburr. <br>
<br>
